# Description:Temperature Density Changes from Dec 2020 to Mar 2021

# Importing the libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


# plotting libraries
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Importing aps2 database 
aps2_filepath = "C:/Users/home/Documents/Hawai'i Maui College/ICS 173 - Intro to Statistics/Week17 - Final Project/1Ambient Parameters Station 2 SXC_03-28-22_UTF-8.csv"
aps2_data = pd.read_csv (aps2_filepath)

#       Cleaning Database
#getting number of missing data points per column
missing_values_count = aps2_data.isnull().sum()

#look at the number of missing points in the seven rows
missing_values_count [0:7]

# total missing values
total_cells = np.product(aps2_data.shape)
total_missing = missing_values_count.sum()

# percent of data that is missing
percent_missing = (total_missing/total_cells) * 100
print(percent_missing)

# erasing missing data  3 rows 
aps2_data= aps2_data.drop (labels= [0,31,41], axis=0)

#Renaming columns for use - changed in excel - this code kept showing old ones
aps2_data.rename (columns={'Ambient Temperature Temp. (Â¡F):': 'Temperature'})
aps2_data.rename (columns={'Rellative Humicity (%)': 'RH'})

#   Creating Plots

sns.distplot (aps2_data['RH'])
plt.title("Temperature Density/RH Changes - Dec 2020 to Mar 2021")

# Conclusion: Both Temperature and RH correlate as Temperatures peaks from  70F to 75F, 
# In conparison with the RH
# It is a progresive increase of RH % starting with 65% and and top peak of 78%
